== Description ==

[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) is an Open Source ERP and CRM. WP Odoo Form Integrator plugin is a bridge between Odoo and several highly used form plugins.

WP Odoo Form Integrator provides the ability to Wordpress admin to bind any Odoo model with any form of the supported types. Once form fields are mapped with Odoo model fields, whenever the form is submitted, the same will also be submitted to Odoo as per the field mapping.

No programming knowledge is required. Anyone who knows the Odoo model that he/she wants to bind can do the integration with WP forms.

The development is in progress. You can expect support for other form types soon. However, please leave your recommended form types in the Support section.

= Is Odoo knowledge needed to configure Odoo-Form Mapping? =
You must be at least aware of Odoo model fields before doing Odoo-Form Mapping. i.e, However some Odoo fields are marked as required, Odoo would still accept null values.
